# inventory

This is a project to practice NodeJS and postgresql concepts, the project will involve creating a fake inventory management store (RPG merchant theme) featuring CRUD operations with items, categories and rarities.

Some improvements that could be made:

- Better file structure to separate related functionality
- Better CSS to reduce repetition
- Minor CSS improvements (mainly layout and spacing of text)
- Better Client side form validation
- Better variable names when passing data into an ejs template, especially if using similar variables elsewhere and how they are related to the data entries in DB
- Remember to stick to variable naming conventions when working with data from different environments E.g camel case for JS, underscores for postgresql data
- Research into how to limit db queries when redirecting back to a form page after invalid user inputs
- Research into how to best handle what should happen on a failed db query
- Research into how to best store selected option element between page reloads in express
- Look into how to format ejs template code inside visual studio
